Living in northern Colorado offers amazing opportunities for mountain flying - the foothills right outside of Fort Collins (where I live) lead directly into the Rocky Mountains. There are 53 peaks in Colorado higher than 14,000' which are known as fourteeners.

Considerations
===

I have read heavily and watched YouTube videos relating to good practices for mountain flying; I am a naturally cautious pilot and planned to use the capabilities of my airplane to take me well above the terrain I'd be crossing. If you came here to see someone skimming past mountain valleys, you're in the wrong place! My plane is turbocharged and loves to climb fast on cold winter days; so I elected to go relatively high-up at more than 14,000'. Also, my plane has in-built O₂ ensuring I am legal with respect to high-altitude flying. Finally, I carry a pulse oximeter which helps confirm my blood oxygen level.

Weather
===

The weather was as close to perfection as you could ever wish to see. Not a cloud below 18,000', winds calm in Fort Collins and Steamboat, and relatively light winds aloft. Although not an issue, I should note that it was cold, particularly in Steamboat Springs where it was -15ºC when I arrived.

The trip
===
I prepped and departed Fort Collins at 9:22am and headed north-west towards the village of Rustic, CO on CO-14 which is the highway up through Poudre Canyon.

As I progressed up the canyon, I could see that I was easily going to have sufficient altitude for the crossing at Cameron Pass so I turned towards it. There were some great mountain views of Long's Peak (and more) off to my left hand side as I flew up the canyon:

Joe Wright Reservoir conveniently points towards Cameron Pass but I had been told (and had read) that the better alternative is a much wider ridge just to the north of the pass. The snowcapped ridge is visible at the upper right of this photo:

Here's a photo as I was crossing the ridge:
