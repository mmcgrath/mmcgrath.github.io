Living in northern Colorado offers amazing opportunities for mountain flying - the foothills right outside of Fort Collins (where I live) lead directly into the Rocky Mountains. There are 53 peaks in Colorado higher than 14,000' which are known as fourteeners.

Considerations
===

I have read heavily and watched YouTube videos relating to good practices for mountain flying; I am a naturally cautious pilot and planned to use the capabilities of my airplane to take me well above the terrain I'd be crossing. If you came here to see someone skimming past mountain valleys, you're in the wrong place! My plane is turbocharged and loves to climb fast on cold winter days.

Weather
===

The weather was as close to perfection as you could ever wish to see. Not a cloud below 18,000', winds calm in Fort Collins and Steamboat, and relatively light winds aloft. Although not an issue, I should note that it was cold, particularly in Steamboat Springs where it was -15ÂºC when I arrived.
